ClusterViz is software architecture visualization tool. It is designed to ï¬‚exibly integrate dependencies and clusterings generated using different tools. It uses special color schemes to manifest architecture quality, and allows the user to choose a subset of the system and/or a subset of dependency types to analyze. 


The project is built on top of Java 8 with some javascript visualization library d3js.

The ClusterViz-0.1.jar is a packed runnable jar of ClusterViz. You can just double click to run it.

All json files in the demo-dataset end with "drh" are valid dv8 clustering input. In mij, there is also a name-space clustering input. To load dependencies of mij, ClusterViz needs to load both the dependencies json and the dependency-type mapping file, in the same directory. 

Also, you can compile a jar by gradle fatJar task. For details, just read the gradle build file.
